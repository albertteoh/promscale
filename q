    Optimize span query based on maximum time duration
    
    Using the max time duration of a trace, we can optimize the query by
    searching chunks only within the window of possibilites when we know
    the time for one of the traces of the span.
    
    We optimize the span, link, and event hypertable scans.
    
    On some tests, decreased query time from 3s to 300ms.

    Improve upgrade test output
    
    The general way that `diff a b` works is to show changes which were made
    to `a` to get to `b`. In PrintDbSnapshotDifferences this was the
    opposite, which made interpreting the result confusing.
    
    Additionally, the diff missed schemas which were in `b`, but not `a`.

    This commit implements the `/api/v1/rules` API.
    
    This implementation is done using the rule-manager in rules package
    along with reusing the structs that Prometheus uses in its API package.
    This ensures that our API response similar to that of Prometheus.

    Refactor rule-manager implementation to consider noop.
    
    Signed-off-by: Harkishen-Singh <harkishensingh@hotmail.com>
    
    This commit refactors the rule-manager with Manager interface that
    allows noop implementation. This allows the API to run properly even
    when the ruler is not initialized in Promscale.
    
    This commit also adds a provider in API package to support rules's access
    to the router.Rules API. The rules cannot be used in pgclient due to cyclic
    imports and poor design. Hence a provider.

    Use getter/setters for default values
    
    We refactored _prom_catalog.default and wrapped it with a getter/setter. This updates connector code that directly accessed the table to use the getter/setter instead.

    Simplify validation of Prometheus config and starting of rules manager.
    
    Signed-off-by: Harkishen-Singh <harkishensingh@hotmail.com>
    
    This commit simplifies the Validate() func in rules package.
    
    It also removes the need for UseRulesManager variable in Config, by making it
    a function on config, which in turn solves the problem of early logging
    of alerting/ruling logs, which now no longer logs in the start of
    Promscale.

    Transfer and use local mod files for migration-tool.
    
    Signed-off-by: Harkishen-Singh <harkishensingh@hotmail.com>
    
    This commit shifts the migration files from /cmd & /pkg/migration-tool
    to /pkg/migration-tool/cmd & /pkg/migration-tool/pkg/ respectively. This
    was done to avoid collision of packages between Promscale and
    Prom-migrator.
    
    Note: This need was felt when a proto panic was felt for enum
    registration since the registration was happening earlier twice -- First
    by Prom-migrator that imports prometheus/prompb and next the rules
    manager that imports the same.

    Adjust to handle new default search path
    
    In [1] we set the default search path to only contain "public" schemas.
    In particular, the two schemas "_prom_ext" and "_prom_catalog" are no
    longer on the default search path.
    
    This makes usages of those functions fully schema-qualified.

    Make prom_admin owner of metric tables and views
    
    Metric tables/views are created dynamically by extension-owned functions. These objects should be owned by the prom_admin.
    This makes them more secure and allows us to better control what can be done with/to these objects. They cannot be
    part of the extension since we can't make them config tables dynamically. They can't be owned by superuser since
    that would prevent dump/restore.
    
    Existing metric tables/views need to be discovered in the takeover script (0.0.0) and have their ownership altered to the superuser.
    
    * alter the search_path of the user doing the snapshots so that objects are fully qualified
    * make the docker image used a flag to enable running the tests locally
    * update docs
    * add_data_node must be called by superuser

    Run tests against corresponding extension docker container
    
    The main goal of this change (which is probably too large) is to ensure
    that we can build the promscale connector against a version of the
    promscale extension which contains all of the necessary bits.
    
    This change is motivated by the fact that there is now a hard dependency
    on the extension, and we need to be able to test in-progress changes
    across repositories.
    
    The basic mechanism is that for each open PR in the promscale_extension
    repo, there will be a docker image built and pushed to the registry at:
    `ghcr.io/timescale/dev_promscale_extension:<special-tag-here>`.
    
    `<special-tag-here>` is constructed from the branch name from which the
    PR originated. When a PR is opened in the promscale repository, we look
    to see if there is already a docker image corresponding to the branch
    name. If not, we fall back to the most recent docker image which was
    built on the `develop` branch in the extension repository.
    
    `<special-tag-here>` has the basic form of:
    
      `<extension-version>-<timescale-major>-<pg-version>`
    
    Some examples are:
    - `jg-ha-dockerfile-ts2-pg14`
    - `develop-ts2-pg14`
    - `0.5.0-ts2-pg14`
    
    Local development is supported through two mechanisms:
    
    1. When running e.g. `make docker-image-14` in the promscale_extension
       repo, the docker image is tagged as: `local/dev_promscale_extension`
       with the `<extension-version>` component of the tag set to `head`.
    2. When running `make test` in the promscale repo, it first looks to see
       if a local image is available matching the `local/` prefix, then
       checks for a docker image derived from the current branch name, and
       then for built from the `develop` branch.
    
    A number of things have changed tangentially as well:
    
    - end_to_end tests now take the docker image which they should run
      against as an argument instead of using some magic to derive it
    - `make test` was split into two components: `make unit` and `make e2e`
    - multinode tests are being skipped because we broke them in the develop
      branch of the promscale extension

    Make the extension required and delegate migrations to the extension
    
    This PR makes the promscale extension required, while the timescaledb extension remains optional.
    The minimum timescaledb version supported is now 2.6.0
    
    The extension now handles applying database migrations. The connector's migration logic was updated accordingly.
    
    If this is a fresh install, the connector will
    
    1. install the extension at the latest version
    
    If promscale is installed at a database version prior to 0.5.0, the connector will
    
    1. apply any pending migrations from the old way of doing migrations
    2. drop the old version of the extension if it exists
    3. install the extension at 0.0.0 which will do some "takeover" logic
    4. update the extension to 0.5.0 (or whatever the latest version of the extension is)
    
    If promscale is installed at database version 0.5.0 or greater, the connector will
    
    1. update the extension to 0.5.0 (or whatever the latest version of the extension is)

    The count of series is usually less then the number of samples/exemplars.

    Signed-off-by: Harkishen-Singh <harkishensingh@hotmail.com>
    
    This commit refactors the metric registration process in telemetry. Now,
    the telemetry engine no longer requires to be passed down to each module
    that wants to send telemetry, rather just expose a func which accepts a
    telemetry engine.
    
    The call of this exposed function happens in runner.go where all modules
    that want to send telemetry are called and managed.

    This commit shifts the alter column file to where it should be, i.e.,
    0.10.0/1-alter_promscale_instance_information_column.sql
    which means, the existing users when update to 0.10 will have the alter
    column.

    Until now, the telemetryEngine's RegisterMetric() accepted only 1 metric
    that required to be monitored. However, with metric renaming work,
    metrics like
    promscale_executed_queries required 2 series to be considered, like
    promscale_query_requests_total{handler="/api/v1/query", code="2xx"} and
    promscale_query_requests_total{handler="/api/v1/query_range",
    code="2xx"}. These are two series but in metric convention, work as different metrics
    (prometheus_metric.With(label-sets) gives
    a metric).

    Rename metrics for ingestor module + some refactorings.
    
    Signed-off-by: Harkishen-Singh <harkishensingh@hotmail.com>
    
    This commit basically refactors metrics in ingestor module to
    pkg/metrics/ingestor.go
    
    It follows the convention of basically 3 labels:
    1. type: used to differentiate between 2 category of metrics in
    promscale which are either 'trace' or 'metric'.
    2. subsystem: this refers to an internal system of the module, like
    the 'copier' or 'metric_batcher'.
    3. kind: this categorizes the metrics that are common between 'samples',
    'metadata' and 'exemplar' or 'spans'.

    Use fully-qualified schema for _prom_catalog.ha_leases
    
    Without a fully-qualified schema, these SQL scripts fail to run when
    executed during the promscale extension install process.

    Refactor out RemoteReadQuerier interface
    
    The Querier interface was a weird mixture of "method to query" and
    "methods to get things with which to query". This change moves "method
    to query" into its own interface.

    Prevent swallowed build errors in e2e tests
    
    GitHub's documentation on `run` [1] and `shell` [2] implies that
    commands invoked via bash will be run with `pipefail`. Unfortunately
    this is not the case. Specifying `bash` as the `shell` does activate
    `pipefail`, and prevent errors in test execution from being swallowed.

    Fix broken pushdown queries
    
    Under certain circumstances, pushdown queries using promscale-extension
    aggregates fail.
    
    The failure comes from the fact that the start and end parameters passed
    to the aggregate don't correctly align with the actual data which is
    aggregated over by the query.
    
    A call to the prom_rate aggregate looks something like the following:
    
    SELECT
        prom_rate(start, end, step_size, range, sample_time, sample_value)
    FROM a_metric
    WHERE a_metric.t >= data_start
      AND a_metric.t <= data_end
    
    If the time span [data_start, data_end] delivers results which are
    outside of the time span [start, end], the aggregate function errors.
    
    In general, this bug appeared when an aggregate pushdown function (such
    as PromQL rate) is used together with a vector selector, such that the
    lookback of the vector selector is larger than that of the aggregate
    pushdown.
    
    The fix is to build the SQL query using the correct values for
    data_start and data_end.

    Do not attempt to push down calls with offsets
    
    We don't correctly handle pushdowns with offsets, so we just skip them
    instead of returning erroneous results.

    Ensure that span start <= end
    
    Adds code to detect when a span's end time is less than its start time. This would be caught by a database constraint and prevent the insertion of the span. The new code will swap the start and end times to allow the span's insertion.
